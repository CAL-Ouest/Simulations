follow Geant4 installation guide online

my installation command with options included
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin/geant4.10.3-install -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11 -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON /usr/local/bin/geant4.10.03

(pass options for X11 and automatic DATA download)

Executable
/usr/local/bin/geant4.10.3-install/bin/geant4.sh



execute example on desktop (youtube Video: example B3 Geant4)
source /usr/local/bin/geant4.10.3-install/bin/geant4.sh
cmake -DGEANT4_DIR=/usr/local/bin/geant4.10.3-install /home/cal/Desktop/B3
